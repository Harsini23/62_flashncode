# Project Title : Excalibur

## Description :

    	Our web site contains two login portals,
        one facilitaes the buying and other the selling option.

## Process:

    		Whole-salers portal:

                 -The whole-sale business owners have an option to sell their products
                  online with an option to auction their products.
    			 -It enables them to interact with the local business owners and opens
                  up an option to local business men to invest in their product.

    		Customer portal:

    			 -Customer will be displayed with all the options to buy from the
                  wholesaler.
                 -Product availability, price details, contact info will
                  be made available.
                 -You can place the order online or can request the
                  contact information and go purchase offline depending on the preference
                  of the customer.
                 -Negotiability will be mentioned in each store if it has any.

                 to upload the product they wish to sell at a base price.
                -There will be filter option which can differntiate cost and quality
                 of the product along with the date in which they are uploaded.

    			-Displays all the items that have been hosted by the owner and their
                 current price, but also includes a whole lot of other details that helps
                 them to identify and purchase the desired product.

## Advantages:

                -In offline shopping, the only way of finding the best price for a product
                 is by visiting multiple shops. Comparing price is a matter of minutes online.
                 With the increasing number of grocery stores, it is easy to compare product prices
                 on various portals and find the lowest price for any product.

                -Like any e-commerce business, online grocery stores also have a larger variety
                 of products available compared to what you find at your local store. Most of the
                 big players claim to have products available from over 1,000 brands. You'll also
                 find that product discovery is easier and you can see all deals special offers in
                 one place.In addition, they typically stock imported brands that are harder to find.
